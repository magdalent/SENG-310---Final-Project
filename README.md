# SENG-310 Final Project
This project was for SENG 310: Human-Computer Interaction. In this project, we designed an AI-powered study assistant for students, where they could generate study plans, calendars, and more. We went through the HCI process, including conducting interviews with real users, creating low-fidelity and then high-fidelity prototypes, research, testing, and eventually creating our final product.
